// Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It //

- The webpage is equally devided by 3.
- Each person will code his relevant section (each picture is named accordingly). 
- We can add other high quality pictures, the important thing is the layout. 
- Just use Lorem to fill in titles and descriptions. 
- We can keep the theme as kiwi green for now.  

PS: This message will NOT self-destruct because this is not mission impossible and we are not secret agents. We are just average programmers trying to make it in this complicated world.
